To predict loan default risk and provide actionable financial insights using machine learning and visualization tools.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (for data extraction)
- Power BI (for dashboard)
- Excel (EDA/cleanup)

---

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing values and outliers
- Performed univariate and bivariate analysis
- Handled categorical features with encoding
- Created new features such as AgeGroup and AccountType
